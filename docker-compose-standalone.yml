    # WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. Being disabled, it can also cause failures without low memory condition, see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
    # sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
    # vm.overcommit_memory=1
    # sudo sysctl -p
    # sysctls:
    #   vm.overcommit_memory: '1' # Active l'overcommit de m√©moire pour Redis
